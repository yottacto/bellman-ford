= Results of SSSP

== Environment

.ipe cluster
* CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v4 (56) @ 2.40GHz
* Memory: 125.925G

.software
* MPI: Open MPI 3.0.0
* Compiler: gcc version 5.5.0
* Graph Partition: metis 5.1.0 (using default parameter)

== Dataset

9th DIMACS Implementation Challenge - Shortest Paths, Full USA road networks
with `23,947,347` nodes and `58,333,344` arcs.

== Results

All time are in seconds.

=== random partition

It takes too long to converge. e.g. the convergence round of 4 hosts is far
more than 2000.

=== continuous partition


=== metis partition
